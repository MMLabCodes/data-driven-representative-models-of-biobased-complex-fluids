Guide to Model Generation
=========================

This guide walks you through the generation of various complex fluid models using quantified molecular data supplemented with DFT outputs.

Each subsection below covers a specific model generation method and how to interpret the results.

It covers a range of things:

- Setting up the code
- Unpacking raw data
- Generating models
- Determining best model

All of the code in this section is presented in the first jupyter notebook **1_Generating_models_of_complex_fluids**. The notebook has a lot of explanations within
it but it is recommended to work through it whilst reading this section of the documentation.

*Note: there is also a **QUICKSTART** version of this notebook - with no explanations*

It is recommended to try one of the example datasets first but it function with any datafiles that are correctly formatted.
