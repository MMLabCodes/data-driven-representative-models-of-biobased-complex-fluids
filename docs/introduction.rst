Welcome to the **Data driven representative models of biobased complex fluids** documentation! This tool allows you to generate representative models
of complex organic fluids. This version (V2) is the first to have proper documentation and it also introduces a new step in the workflow that allows
for generation of starting structures for amber MD using the generated representative models.

The key features of this package are:
- Generating Data driven representative models of biobased complex fluids

- Preparing molecular dynamic simulations (i.e. parameterization, system building)  

To get started, please check out the installation instructions below.
